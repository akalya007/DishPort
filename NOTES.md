# Episode 02

+ [[Parcel)) is a web application bundler, often used in React development, that focuses on providing a fast and easy development experience with minimal configuration. It distinguishes itself from other bundlers through its "zero-configuration" approach, meaning it automatically handles many build processes that would otherwise require manual setup.n



  PARCEL IS AMAZING , IT GIVES THE MUSCELES TO THE SKELETON.IT GIVES THE ENERGY TO THE APP.--PARCEL IS ALSO NOT DOING EVERYTHING BY OWN,IIT IS ALSO DOING ALTHOSE LIBRARYS.    

# Parcel

- Dev Build
- Local Server
- HMR - hot module Replacement
- File watching Algorithm -- written in c++
- Catchig - faster builds.
- Image Optimization
- Bundling
- Compress
- Minification --in Production.
- tree shaking - remove unused code.
- Differential bundling 
- 
- 
- * parcel-cache and dist --can be regenerated

- # Browser
 = we what to tell the apps,that what are the browser shoukd use


# episode 5

+ whenever there is change in the state variable, React will find out the difference between the virtual Dom and it will re-render the component.it will update the Dom 

--why react is faster, beacuse react has virtual Dom , it has the Diff Algorithm , which has very efficient Dom manipulation 



# we can use crosproxy instead of using the cors extension.   we can use it before the api,but it has the limit approximately like 40 request within the minute.



# 2 types Routing in web apps

- [Server side Routing)==if we have home.html , about.html , contact.html
-    ==>if i click on my anchor tag(contact , about)--it reloads the Whole page==it sends the network call to about.html , it fetches it on the webpage.it refers the whole page . this is server side routing.
- 
- - [client side routing)--but in this, we use <Link></Link>--all the components are already loaded to the app.
- 
- 
- # [ # SINGLE PAGE APPLICATIOM)
- =============================
- Its just one page , only the componenets getting interchanged via *client side routing.



# there are more option to ADD THE CSS 

--by using the [Styled Componenets)
--[Material UI)--we already have the pre-build components--we can  just import , and we can use of it.
--Bootstrap
--chakra UI
--Ant Design.
--SCSS and SaSS.

============================================================================================================

# Redux
=======

+ React and the Redux are the different libraries of the JavaScript.Both are not same.Redux is also use with other 
--we install in our application .

+ Reduc is not the Only Library for State management, there is the library zustand, it is also used for the StateManagement library.

# Redux is primarily used to handling State of the Application.
# Another Advantage when we use redux, our Application is Easy to debug. "Redux offers easy debugging"--we have the redux dev tools.

--Using the Redux--we are building the cart, while Adding the Items , then it should shoe in the cart , and then building the cartpage.

# Redux store is the Object , and kept in the Global central place.and any Component can access in our Application.
+ it is the very Big Object , with lot of data inside it.

[SLICES)
=======

--we have different slices in the Store
--for Example , we have cartSlice , UserSlice , for the loggedIn user.

# we cannot modifies the CartSlice directly while clicking the Add button .

# when we click on the Add+ button ---In will [Dispatch the Action) --[that call the Function)--that function Internally modifies the Cart.

# that function basically Reducer.

**REDUX**
========

-installing two package, react-redux, @reduxjs/toolkit
-Build our store
-Connect our store to our app.
-Slice(cartSlice)
-dispatch(action)
-Selextor



# Testing(developer)

* Different types of testing
=============================

1) Unit testing.
================
  Testng the specific unit in isolation 
  Testing the specific small unit or any one components from thewhole react Application.(for example Testing the header Components. )

2) Integration testing.
======================
Multiple Components are involved, and talking to each other.

3) End to End Testing(e2e testing).
===================================



Testing Library
===============
1.Reactt Testing library--Standard library--used to write the test case in Reacr.
npm i -D @testing-library/react

2. install jest--we use jest along with babel
  npm i -D jest

3. Install babel configuration---it is inside the jest website(copy paste that one line)
4. Configure babel.(By creating the babel.config.js).

5. configure Parcel config file  to disable default babel transpilation.(go to parcel , scroll down , in the JavaScript go to Babel(which is in right hand side,the go   "Usage with other tools")).

6. then in the terminal "npm run test"
7. jest configuration---npm create jest    (no--jsdom , BABEL , THEN yes for all)
8. insall jsdom.----npm install --save-dev jest-environment-jsdom
9. npm i -D @babel/preset-react---install this to make Jsx work in testcases.
10. include @babel/preset-react inside the babel config---add thi inside the babel config.
   "['@babel/preset-react' , {runtime: 'automatic'}],"
11. npm i -D @testing-library/jest-dom----------this is the library to used tobeInTheDocument()




//* Testing code is not run on the browser.it will runs on jsdom.
//* (jsdom) is not the browser , its like the browser , it gives the super power of the browser. The testing code runs over the jsdom.if we testing the header componenet , header Component will be loads here , in jsdom
