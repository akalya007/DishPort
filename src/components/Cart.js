/**
 * NoteðŸ˜€--Interview pointofview.
 * 
 * way1 and way2
 * =============
 * mistake1 we doo-->
 * ========
 * The better performance way to subcribe to the specific portion of the store--way 1 is best
 * 
 * in the way 2---if any updation in anu other slice in the store, it may be get affected---so noo need to subcribe to the whole store
 * 
 * In the way1--it will only update when the items in the cart updates[when store.cart.items updates].
 * 
 * Mistake2-->
 * ========
 * In Creating the Store, we have reducer.one reducer.inside that reducer , we have multiple reducer.
 * In creting the Slice , we  have reducers. inside that we have multiple reducer function....while exporting we export single reducer.
 * 
 * Basically waht is reducer:
 *      It is the Combination of multiple small reducer.

 * useSelector
 * ===========
 * 
 * --why the name is selector?... because we are selecting the portion of the store...thats why it is selector.
