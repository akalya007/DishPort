   //return {items :[] };   //also we can do like this.will be replaced originalState = {items :[] }

/**
 * createSlice is used for creating the Slice
 * 
 * For Creating Slice, we have some configuration.
 * like name , initialState,reducers
 * name of the slice
 * in the reducer--we write those reducer function corresponding to the actions.
 * actions are Add the item , clear the Items etc.
 * 
* ==> additem is teh action --whe clicking the Add buton , it should update the slice in the store.
But how to update the Slice of the Store?
To modify the Slice in the store,it get Access to the State(initial state in the empty array.) and it also get access to the action.

/**
 * NoteðŸ˜€
 * 
 * createSlice will return the Object.
 * 
 * cartSlice will be ðŸ‘‡
 * 
 * {
 *  actions:{
 *    addItem,removeItem,etc.  [hence taking out individually and exportig]
 *   },
 *  reducer:{
 * 
 *  }

/**
 * Difference between older redux and the Atpresent redux
 * ======================================================
 *   addItem :(state , action)=>{    //two parameters
        //vanilla(older) redux= redux says that Dont't mutate the state.(returning is mandatary)
    (older)     //const newState = [...state];
        //  newState.items.push(action.payload);
        // return newState;

        //redux Toolkit
        //we have to mutate the State--returning is not mandatory
    (newer) state.items.push(action.payload);

    }

---> In the newer, redux is actualy doing like in the older way , but it dont wnat to developer to do.
Redux toolkit uses the immer library behind the sceens.
