//Lazy loading in React is a technique used to improve the performance of React applications by loading components or modules only when they are needed. This approach can significantly reduce the initial loading time of an application, especially for large-scale projects with many components. 
// The core idea behind lazy loading is to split the application's code into smaller chunks. Instead of loading all the code at once, only the necessary code for the current view is loaded initially. When a user navigates to a different part of the application, the code for that part is loaded on demand.
// React provides built-in support for lazy loading using the React.lazy() function and the Suspense component.
// React.lazy(): This function takes a dynamic import as its argument and returns a component that will be loaded lazily. The dynamic import allows you to load a module asynchronously, which is crucial for lazy loading.
// Suspense: This component is used to wrap the lazily loaded component. It allows you to specify a fallback UI that will be displayed while the component is being loaded.
